      <p class="card-text">This is me before I was diagnosed with 2nd stage cancer in liver, when I worked as a marketing associate in a huge multinational firm. My life was always fun-filled, adventurous and lively. But after the diagnosis my whole life started falling apart and I started falling into the grips of depression. Suddenly my life went dark and everything that once got me excited stopped making sense and everything seemed pointless. I stopped partying, stopped laughing and hanging out with people. I even stopped going to work. Then one day while I was surfing the internet I came across a quote which went like "Life is unpredictable, Live it while you still can", I felt each and every word of this quote. Today, when I look back I can see how much I have grown as a person and how much faith I have developed in life. Now I want to share my story with everyone out there who is struggling just like I was and I want to tell them EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT, YOU WILL BE ALRIGHT, this is not just my story, it is "OUR STORY".</p>

      <p class="card-text">3 years back, I was facing a lot of pressure from my work place and then came a time when my mental health broke down and I fell into the grips of depression and anxiety and it kept on getting worse to such an extent that I was paralysed for the better half of 2 years. But then one day I met a man in the hospital who told me about his story (which was much worse than mine) and faced the same condition that I was currently in and then he told me that his will to live was even stronger than his ailments, this cured him. I was suddenly feeling warm and calm, suddenly I saw a light of hope in life. That day I realised that one person can affect others mind to such an extent that they can recover from all problems of their life and this made me think that a community full of such people who can come together and be each other's inspiration will do so good in the society and it was that is really required by this generation.</p>

      <p class="card-text">I was diagnosed with leukemia at a young age, and my world was turned upside down. It was a dark and difficult time, but with the love and support of my family and friends, I was determined to fight. I underwent grueling treatments and faced many setbacks, but I refused to give up.

        Slowly but surely, I began to see progress. My blood counts improved, and I regained my strength. Finally, after months of battling, I received the news I had been praying for â€“ I was cancer-free.
        
        The journey was tough, but I emerged from it stronger and more grateful for life than ever before. I now live each day to the fullest, cherishing every moment with my loved ones and grateful for the gift of health.

      <p class="card-text">I used to suffer from PTSD after a traumatic event in my past. It felt like a heavy weight that I couldn't shake off. But with the help of therapy and support from loved ones, I slowly started to work through my trauma. It wasn't easy, but I learned to recognize my triggers and cope with them in a healthy way. Today, I am proud to say that I have overcome my PTSD and am living a happy, fulfilling life.</p>

      <p class="card-text">When I was first diagnosed with cancer, I was terrified. But I didn't let that fear consume me. I chose to fight back with everything I had. I underwent intense chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and while they were tough, I refused to let them defeat me. I also made important lifestyle changes, like improving my diet and incorporating exercise into my daily routine.

        With the support of my family and medical team, I pushed through the tough times and kept my eyes on the finish line. And finally, after months of treatment, I received the news that my cancer was in remission. It was the best feeling in the world. Now, I am committed to staying healthy and living life to the fullest. I know that I am strong enough to overcome any obstacle, and that my experience has only made me stronger.</p>
